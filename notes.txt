
- you don't need to setup the (https://github.com/topcoder-platform/member-processor-es),
  because there is seed-data script to setup data to test the members API,
  the tests also have setup data properly

- for the verify email API processing logic,
  see old java source code:
  ap-member-microservice\service\src\main\java\com\appirio\service\member\manager\MemberProfileManager.java line 418,
  you can see old java source code at:

- for the upload photo API, the response is changed to { photoURL: "..." } instead of just a string, this is more clear

- for member profile, the 'newEmail', 'emailVerifyToken', 'emailVerifyTokenDate', 'newEmailVerifyToken', 'newEmailVerifyTokenDate'
  fields are some internal fields, they are stored in ES and DB, but no need to be included in API input/output,
  swagger is updated for this

- note that the tests use mock S3 service, so you may use the provided mock AWS credential for tests,
  but Postman tests require using real AWS S3, you need to follow README.md to create S3 bucket and provide your own AWS credential
  so that the upload photo API works
